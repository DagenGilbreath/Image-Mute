Python script to mute (I'm not interested in this Tweet) images on Twitter based on text content found within. 

TODO: Implement image scraping from Twitter

TODO: Set up credentials and logic for continuous scraping

DIRECTIONS:
Install Tessaract OCR to run the script @ https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/

Run main.py with the directory of your tesseract.exe and the phrases you wish to mute (comma separated)
EX) python main.py C:/Users/name/AppData/Local/Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe "annoying phrase","another phrase"
